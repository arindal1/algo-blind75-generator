## Summary

This comprehensive guide covers **22 essential DSA patterns** with **380+ carefully selected problems** from LeetCode and other platforms. Each pattern includes problems ranging from Easy to Hard difficulty levels, ensuring progressive skill development.

**Key Features:**
- **Pattern-based organization** for efficient learning
- **Direct LeetCode links** for immediate practice
- **Balanced difficulty progression** within each pattern
- **Interview-focused problem selection** based on frequency and importance
- **Complete coverage** of all major DSA concepts

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Master each pattern with Easy problems first
2. Progress to Medium problems to build confidence
3. Tackle Hard problems for advanced preparation
4. Focus on understanding the underlying pattern rather than memorizing solutions
5. Practice implementing solutions in C++ with optimal time/space complexity

This guide provides the foundation for cracking technical interviews at top product-based companies. Focus on understanding the patterns deeply rather than just solving problems individually.
